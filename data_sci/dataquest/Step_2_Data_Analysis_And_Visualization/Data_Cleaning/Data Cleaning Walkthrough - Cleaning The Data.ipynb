    "## 1: Getting Started With A Data Science Project\n",
    "At many points in your career, you'll need to be able to build complete, end-to-end data science projects on your own. Data science projects are usually one of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An exploration and analysis of a set of data. An example would be analyzing donors to political campaigns, making a plot, then sharing your analysis of the plot with other.\n",
    "- An operational system that works with data that is constantly updated, and generates predictions. An example would be an algorithm that pulls in stock ticker data daily and makes predictions about which stocks will go up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to create projects will be useful in several different contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Projects allow you to construct a portfolio, which is critical in being hired as a data analyst or scientist.\n",
    "- Projects help teach you new skills and reinforce existing concepts.\n",
    "- Most \"real-world\" data science or analysis work consists of developing internal projects.\n",
    "- Projects allow you to investigate interesting phenomena and satisfy your curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be employed as a data scientist or data analyst, or if you're merely curious about the world, building projects can be immensely rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here's](https://github.com/dataquestio/loan-prediction) an example of a finished project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll walk through the first part of a complete data science project. In this project, we'll go from acquiring raw data all the way through to analyzing it. The project will focus on exploration and analysis of a set of data. We'll develop our data cleaning and storytelling skills, which will enable us to build complete projects on our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll primarily focus on data exploration, and combining several messy datasets into one clean one that enables us to analyze it easily. In the next few missions, we'll work through the rest of our project, and do meaningful analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in creating a project is to decide on your topic. You want the topic to be something you're interested in, and are motivated to explore. It's very obvious when people are making projects just to make them, and when people are making projects because they're genuinely interested in exploring the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two ways to find a good topic are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find datasets in those sectors.\n",
    "- Explore many datasets, and find one that seems interesting enough to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pick either course, here are some good sites to start with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) -- contains government data.\n",
    "- [/r/datasets](https://reddit.com/r/datasets) -- a subreddit that has hundreds of interesting datasets.\n",
    "- [Awesome datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) -- a list of datasets, hosted on Github.\n",
    "- [rs.io](http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/) -- a great blog post with hundreds of interesting datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world data science, you often won't find a nice single dataset that you can browse. You might have to aggregate disparate data sources, or do a good amount of data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we'll be using data about New York City public schools, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?tags=doe)."

    "## 2: Finding All The Relevent Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've picked a topic, you'll want to pick an angle you want to investigate. It's important to pick an angle that's ambitious enough to have enough depth to analyze, but isn't so complicated that it makes it hard to get started. You want to finish the project, and you want your results to be interesting to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the US educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they are unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge about this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographic factors might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high schoolers take in the US before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when making admissions decisions, so it's fairly important to do well on. The test is divided into 3 sections, each of which is scored out of 800 points. The total score is out of 2400 (although this has changed back and forth a few times, the scores in this dataset are out of 2400). High schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a dataset of SAT scores [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), and a dataset that contains information on each high school [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2). Here are the first few rows of the SAT data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/sat.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, both datasets together aren't enough to fully give us all the demographic factors we want to correlate SAT scores to. We'll need to supplement our data with other datasets in order to analyze the factors we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several related datasets on the same website that cover demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the datasets we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) -- SAT scores for each high school in New York City.\n",
    "- [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt) -- attendance information on every school in NYC.\n",
    "- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) -- class size information for each school in NYC.\n",
    "- [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) -- Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. High schools students in the US can choose to take AP exams. There are several AP exams, one for each subject. Passing an AP exam can get you college credit in that subject.\n",
    "- [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) -- percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.\n",
    "- [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) -- demographic information for each school.\n",
    "- [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8) -- surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these datasets are interrelated, and we'll need to combine them into a single dataset before we can do the correlations we want."

    "- Schools in New York City are divided into several school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Not all the schools in all of the datasets are high schools, so we'll need to do some data cleaning.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a DBN, or District Borough Number.\n",
