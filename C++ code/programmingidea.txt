run function over an over with random list increasing in length each time

get the inputs first and then use them (not sure if rand() takes time)


get array vector of count and runtime

figure out how to graph this quickly/cleanly

figure out how to approximate/fit the O()

possibly add a gui for inputting total size or random list increase gradient

add it to github
