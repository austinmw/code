/* 
<cstdio> (stdio.h)  (header)
C library to perform Input/Output operations
(C++ alternative is <fstream>, or can still use <cstdio>)

Input and Output operations can also be performed in C++ using the C Standard Input and Output Library 
(cstdio, known as stdio.h in the C language). This library uses what are called streams to operate with 
physical devices such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files supported by the system. 
Streams are an abstraction to interact with these in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties 
independently of the individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.

Streams are handled in the cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects. A pointer to a FILE object uniquely 
identifies a stream, and is used as a parameter in the operations involving that stream.

There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and stderr, which are automatically created and opened 
for all programs using the library. 

Stream properties 
Streams have some properties that define which functions can be used on them and how these will treat the data 
input or output through them. Most of these properties are defined at the moment the stream is associated 
with a file (opened) using the fopen function:
Read/Write Access
Specifies whether the stream has read or write access (or both) to the physical media they are associated with. 
Text / Binary
Text streams are thought to represent a set of text lines, each one ending with a new-line character. 
Depending on the environment where the application is run, some character translation may occur with text streams 
to adapt some special characters to the text file specifications of the environment. A binary stream, on the other 
hand, is a sequence of characters written or read from the physical media with no translation, having a one-to-one 
correspondence with the characters read or written to the stream.
Buffer
A buffer is a block of memory where data is accumulated before being physically read or written to the associated 
file or device. Streams can be either fully buffered, line buffered or unbuffered. On fully buffered streams, 
data is read/written when the buffer is filled, on line buffered streams this happens when a new-line character 
is encountered, and on unbuffered streams characters are intended to be read/written as soon as possible.
Orientation
On opening, streams have no orientation. As soon as an input/output operation is performed on them, they become 
either byte-oriented or wide-oriented, depending on the operation performed (generally, functions defined in <cstdio> 
are byte-oriented, while functions in <cwchar> are wide-oriented). See cwchar for more info.


Indicators 
Streams have certain internal indicators that specify their current state and which affect the behavior of some 
input and output operations performed on them:
Error indicator
This indicator is set when an error has occurred in an operation related to the stream. This indicator can be 
checked with the ferror function, and can be reset by calling either to clearerr, freopen or rewind.
End-Of-File indicator
When set, indicates that the last reading or writing operation performed with the stream reached the End of File. 
It can be checked with the feof function, and can be reset by calling either to clearerr or freopen or by calling 
to any repositioning function (rewind, fseek and fsetpos).
Position indicator
It is an internal pointer of each stream which points to the next character to be read or written in the next 
I/O operation. Its value can be obtained by the ftell and fgetpos functions, and can be changed using the repositioning 
functions rewind, fseek and fsetpos.

/* There are a few behavior differences in the two approaches. If you use fgets() + sscanf(), 
you must enter both values on the same line, whereas fscanf() on stdin (or equivalently, scanf()) 
will read them off different lines if it doesn't find the second value on the first line you entered.

But, probably the most important differences have to do with handling error cases and the mixing of 
line oriented input and field oriented input.

If you read a line that you're unable to parse with sscanf() after having read it using fgets() your 
program can simply discard the line and move on. However, fscanf(), when it fails to convert fields, 
leaves all the input on the stream. So, if you failed to read the input you wanted, you'd have to go 
and read all the data you want to ignore yourself.

The other subtle gotcha comes in if you want to mix field oriented (ala scanf()) with line oriented 
(e.g. fgets()) calls in your code. When scanf() converts an int for example, it will leave behind a \n 
on the input stream (assuming there was one, like from pressing the enter key), which will cause a 
subsequent call to fgets() to return immediately with only that character in the input. This is a really 
common issue for new programmers.

So, while you are right that you can just use fscanf() like that, you may be able to avoid some headaches 
by using fgets() + sscanf(). */

Sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position.
For streams open in binary mode, the new position is defined by adding offset to a reference position 
specified by origin.
For streams open in text mode, offset shall either be zero or a value returned by a previous call to ftell,
and origin shall necessarily be SEEK_SET.

The end-of-file internal indicator of the stream is cleared after a successful call to this function, 
and all effects from previous calls to ungetc on this stream are dropped. 
On streams open for update (read+write), a call to fseek allows to switch between reading and writing. 
PARAMETERS:
stream
Pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream.
offset 
Binary files: Number of bytes to offset from origin.
Text files: Either zero, or a value returned by ftell. 
origin
Position used as reference for the offset. It is specified by one of the following constants 
defined in <cstdio> exclusively to be used as arguments for this function:
Constant	Reference position
SEEK_SET	Beginning of file 
SEEK_CUR	Current position of the file pointer
SEEK_END	End of file *

/* 

Every FILE stream has an internal flag that indicates whether the caller has tried to read past 
the end of the file already. feof returns that flag. The flag does not indicate whether the current 
file position is as the end of the file, only whether a previous read has tried to read past the end of the file.
This means that if you do while(!feof(pFile)) getc(), getc() will actually read the special value for EOF, which
is the same for end-offile and error. 


You can get a better understanding of how feof works, by knowing how it's implemented. 
Here is a simplified version of how the 7th Edition Unix stdio library implements feof. 
Modern libraries are very similar, adding code offering thread-safety, increased efficiency,
and a cleaner implementation.

extern  struct  _iobuf { 
	char    *_ptr;
	int     _cnt; 
	char    *_base; 
	char    _flag;
	char    _file; 
} _iob[_NFILE];

#define _IOEOF  020 
  
#define feof(p)         (((p)->_flag&_IOEOF)!=0)

#define getc(p)         (--(p)->_cnt>=0? *(p)->_ptr++&0377:_filbuf(p)) 

int 
_filbuf(FILE *iop) 
{

	iop->_ptr = iop->_base; 
	iop->_cnt = read(fileno(iop), iop->_ptr, BUFSIZ);
	if (iop->_cnt == 0) { 
			iop->_flag |= _IOEOF; 
			return(EOF);
	}
	return(*iop->_ptr++ & 0377); 
}

The stdio library maintains with each file a structure containing an internal buffer pointed by _base. 
The current character in the buffer is pointed by _ptr and the number of characters available is 
contained in _cnt. The getc macro, which is the base for a lot of higher-level functionality, like scanf, 
tries to return a character from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, it will call _filbuf to fill it.
_filbuf in turn will call read. If read returns 0, which means that no more data is available, _filbuf 
will set the _IOEOF flag, which feof checks each time you call it to return true.

As you can understand from the above, feof will return true the first time you try to read a character 
past the end of the file (or a library function tries in your behalf). This has subtle implications on 
the behavior of various functions. Consider a file containing a single character: the digit 1. After 
you read that character with getc, feof will return false, because the _IOEOF flag is unset; nobody has 
yet tried to read past the end of the file. Calling getc again will result in a call to read, the setting 
of the _IOEOF flag, and this will cause feof to return true. However, after reading the number from the same 
file using fscanf("%d", &n), feof will immediately return true, because fscanf will have tried to read 
additional digits of the integer.

How does feof() actually know when the end of file is reached?
Whatever else the C++ library does, eventually it has to read from the file. 
Somewhere in the operating system, there is a piece of code that eventually handles that read. 
It obtains from the filesystem the length of the file, stored the same way the filesystem stores 
everything else. Knowing the length of the file, the position of the read, and the number of bytes to 
be read, it can make the determination that the low-level read hits the end of the file.

When that determination is made, it is passed up the stack. Eventually, it gets to the standard library 
which records internally that the end of file has been reached. When a read request into the library 
tries to go past that recorded end, the EOF flag is set and feof will start returning true.

How EOF is detected is OS/FS-specific and has nothing to do whatsoever with the C library/language. 
The OS has some interface to read data from files. The C library is just a bridge between the OS and 
the program, so you don't have to change your program if you move to another OS. The OS knows how the
files are stored in its filesystem, so it knows how to detect EOF. My guess is that typically it is 
performed by comparing the current position to the length of the file, but it may be not that easy 
and may involve a lot of low-level details (for example, what if the file is on a network drive?). */

// #define defines macros.
/* All of these are constants, except for NULL, which is a macro that expands to a null pointer constant

BUFSIZE (Buffer size): This macro constant expands to an integral expression with the size of the buffer 
used by the setbuf function.

EOF (End-of-File): It is a macro definition of type int that expands into a negative integral constant 
expression (generally, -1).
It is used as the value returned by several functions in header <cstdio> to indicate that the End-of-File 
has been reached or to signal some other failure conditions.
It is also used as the value to represent an invalid character. 
In C++, this macro corresponds to the value of char_traits<char>::eof(). 

FILENAME_MAX (Maximum length of file names): This macro constant expands to an integral expression 
corresponding to the size needed for an array of char elements to hold the longest file name string 
allowed by the library. Or, if the library imposes no such restriction, it is set to the recommended 
size for character arrays intended to hold a file name.
	
FOPEN_MAX (Potential limit of simultaneous open streams): This macro constant expands to an integral 
expression that represents the maximum number of files that can be opened simultaneously.
Particular library implementations may count files opened by tmpfile towards this limit. Implementations 
may also allow more files to be opened beyond this limit.
FOPEN_MAX shall be greater than 7 on all systems.
	
L_tmpnam (Minimum length for temporary file name): This macro constant expands to an integral expression 
corresponding to the size needed for an array of char elements to hold the longest file name string 
possibly generated by tmpnam.
	
NULL (Null pointer): A null pointer constant can be converted to any pointer type (or pointer-to-member type), 
which acquires a null pointer value. This is a special value that indicates that the pointer is not pointing 
to any object.
	
TMP_MAX (Number of temporary files): This macro expands to the minimum number of unique temporary file names 
that are guaranteed to be possible to generate using tmpnam.
This value cannot be lower than 25. 
Particular library implementations may count file names used by files created with tmpfile towards this limit.

/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TYPES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */
/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TYPES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */ /*
// typedef defines types.

FILE     
(Object containing information to control a stream)
Object type that identifies a stream and contains the information needed to control it, including a 
pointer to its buffer, its position indicator and all its state indicators.

FILE objects are usually created by a call to either fopen or tmpfile, which both return a pointer to 
one of these objects.

The content of a FILE object is not meant to be accessed from outside the functions of the <cstdio> and 
<cwchar> headers; In fact, portable programs shall only use them in the form of pointers to identify 
streams, since for some implementations, even the value of the pointer itself could be significant to 
identify the stream (i.e., the pointer to a copy of a FILE object could be interpreted differently than 
a pointer to the original).

Its memory allocation is automatically managed: it is allocated by either fopen or tmpfile, and it is 
the responsibility of the library to free the resources once either the stream has been closed using 
fclose or the program terminates normally.

On inclusion of the <cstdio> header file, three objects of this type are automatically created, and 
pointers to them are declared: stdin, stdout and stderr, associated with the standard input stream, 
standard output stream and standard error stream, respectively.



fpos_t     
(Object containing information to specify a position within a file)
This type of object is used to specify a position within a file. An object of this type is capable of 
specifying uniquely any position within a file.

The information in fpos_t objects is usually filled by a call to fgetpos, which takes a pointer to an 
object of this type as argument.

The content of an fpos_t object is not meant to be read directly, but only to be used as an argument 
in a call to fsetpos.



size_t     
(Unsigned integral type)
Alias of one of the fundamental unsigned integer types. 

It is a type able to represent the size of any object in bytes: size_t is the type returned by the 
sizeof operator and is widely used in the standard library to represent sizes and counts.

In <cstdio>, it is used as the type of some parameters in the functions fread, fwrite and setvbuf, 
and in the case of fread and fwrite also as its returning type.

The size_t type is the unsigned integer type that is the result of the sizeof operator 
(and the offsetof operator), so it is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the 
biggest object your system can handle (e.g., a static array of 8Gb).

The size_t type may be bigger than, equal to, or smaller than an unsigned int, and your 
compiler might make assumptions about it for optimization.
