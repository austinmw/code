Generally, to check algorithm performance, you

take the average of several attempts.
time the performance of several different sized containers.
In pseudocode:

For N in [2..9]:
	Fill container with 10^N items
	lookupTime = 0;
	generate M values in range
	for i in [1..M]:
		lookupTime += duration(lookup(value[i]))
	performance[N] = lookupTime/M;
