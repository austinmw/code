A .java file contains Java code.

A .class file is the .java file compiled

A .jar file is an executable java package.

Eclipse compiles .java files to create .class files and you can package them in an executable .jar file.




A .java file contains your Java source code while a .class file contains the Java bytecode produced by the Java compiler. It is your .class files that run on the JVM to execute a Java application. It is the .class files you will use when you deploy your applet.
