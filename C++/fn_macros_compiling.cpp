/* FUNCTIONS VS MACROS:
To define preprocessor macros we can use #define. Its syntax is:

	#define identifier replacement

	When the preprocessor encounters this directive, it replaces any occurrence of identifier in the rest of the code by replacement. This replacement can be an expression, a statement, a block or simply anything. The preprocessor does not understand C++ proper, it simply replaces any occurrence of identifier by replacement.

	1
	2
	3
	#define TABLE_SIZE 100
	int table1[TABLE_SIZE];
	int table2[TABLE_SIZE]; 


	After the preprocessor has replaced TABLE_SIZE, the code becomes equivalent to:

	1
	2
	int table1[100];
	int table2[100]; 	
	
	
Macros are error-prone because they rely on textual substitution and do not perform type-checking  
Finally, macros can be difficult to debug, producing weird syntax errors or runtime errors that you have to 
expand to understand (e.g. with gcc -E), because debuggers cannot step through macros

C++ has a number of features such as TEMPLATES to help create complex polymorphic constructs in a typesafe 
way without the use of macros

Macros are substituted directly into the program by the preprocessor (since they basically are preprocessor 
directives). So they inevitably use more memory space than a respective function. On the other hand, a function 
requires more time to be called and to return results, and this overhead can be avoided by using macros.

Also macros have some special tools that can help with program portability on different platforms.

Macros don't need to be assigned a data type for their arguments in contrast with functions.

Overall they are a useful tool in programming. And both macroinstructions and functions can be used depending on 
the circumstances.

/*  INCLUDES, COMPILING, PREPROCESSING, LINKING
 * Suggested reading order: main.cpp, vector_algos.hpp, vector_algos.cpp
 *
 * This chapter is unlike all the previous ones, because instead of having a
 * single main.cpp file the directory should contain main.cpp, vector_algos.hpp
 * and vector_algos.cpp.  We're going to leave the previous program almost
 * unchanged, but instead of lumping everything together into one file we'll
 * neatly split it out.  You can see our main function below: it is entirely
 * unchanged.
 *
 * The new files added are another source file and a header file.  The source
 * file, vector_algos.cpp, behaves just like main.cpp; it will be compiled the same way, as
 * described further.  We are going to define all our algorithms for working on
 * vectors in there.
 *
 * The header file, vector_algos.hpp, is somewhat different.  We will not give
 * it to the compiler directly; instead, we will include it in our source files.
 * This is only marginally useful in this example, as only main.cpp really needs
 * to include it.  However, as our projects grow large we won't want to
 * duplicate all our function declarations by hand.  Instead, we will write them
 * in header files and use include directives to copy their contents into our
 * source files.
 *
 * This is exactly what the include directive does: it takes everything in that
 * file and literally copy-pastes it where our include directive was.  Do not
 * expect any kind of special treatment: if you include a file twice, it will be
 * pasted in twice.  If file A includes file B, and file B includes file C, file
 * A will get a copy of file C inside it.  If file A includes file B, and file B
 * includes file A, your program will not compile.
 *
 * What happens when a program is compiled, anyway?  The process can be split
 * into three stages:
 *
 *  - First of all, the preprocessor is run over all the files.  This removes
 *  comments and handles all preprocessor directives.  After this, every source
 *  file has become a single compilable entity called a Translation Unit.
 *  Header files are no longer necessary.
 *  - Secondly, the compiler runs on each source file and outputs an object
 *  file.  This is the compiled code for that one file; it is not yet an
 *  executable, as not all functions are necessarily defined.  It is here that
 *  most of the translation is done; after this step, finding the C++ code back
 *  is not possible.
 *  - Thirdly, the linker takes all our object files and then links them into an
 *  executable, which we can run.
 *
 * Why not glue all the source files together before compiling?  C++ is a
 * complex language, and compiling it takes a long time.  By doing the
 * preprocessing and compiling separately for every file, we don't need to
 * recompile translation units that haven't changed since we last compiled.
 * Only linking needs to look at all of the files, but that is relatively fast.
 * Even for small projects, this can make the difference between being able to
 * test your changes directly and having to wait a minute or two for it to
 * build.
 *
 * Because of this, it is a good idea to minimize the number of things you
 * include: the more headers a file depends on, the more likely it is it will
 * need to be recompiled.  The advice boils down to "include everything you
 * need, and no more", which admittedly is not all that specific.
 *
 * You might have noticed that so far, we've not seen the preprocessed files or
 * object files.  This is because with a project this small, we can ask the
 * compiler to keep the results in memory between the steps.  Even with bigger
 * projects, the preprocessing output is usually not stored; object files,
 * however, are usually written to disk for reusability.
 *
 * Enough chatter, let's look at the program.

// What to include and in what order is an interesting question.  Due to the
// copy-paste nature of includes, if vector_algos.hpp includes iostream and
// vector, we don't need to include those two.  Can we be sure it will, though?
// We know that the only work we do on vectors is with the functions from it, so
// that's fine.  We don't have any reason to be sure it will include iostream,
// though, so we include that ourselves.
//
// As to the order, you should do your best to stop includees relying on the
// prior includes of their includers.  A mouthful?  Let's say A includes B and
// then C.  If C needs B, C should include B itself, not rely on A including B
// first.  Thus, include your own headers first of all, then the headers of the
// third-party libraries you use, and finally the standard library headers.
#include "vector_algos.hpp"
#include <iostream>


// Look at how clean and simple this is!
// Once you're done admiring it, read vector_algos.hpp
int main() {
	auto v = read_int_vector();

	std::cout << "Average: " << average(v) << "\n";
	std::cout << "Sum: " << sum(v) << "\n";

	std::cout << "Elements greater than 5:";
	for (auto e : filter_greater_than(v, 5))
		std::cout << " " << e;
	std::cout << "\n";

	// By the way, we've been writing return 0; at the end of every main
	// function.  As I said before, the main function is weird: for example, you
	// can't call it from inside your program.  Another (nice) quirk it has is
	// that you are allowed to omit the return statement at the end, and the
	// compiler will assume you returned 0.  This means we can stop writing it
	// out now and let the compiler do the work.
	//
	// As you may have noticed, I'm extremely lazy and love letting software do
	// work for me.
