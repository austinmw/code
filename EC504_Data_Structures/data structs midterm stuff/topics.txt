LINKED LIST
address of the head node gives access to the complete list
address in last node is null or 0
have to traverse from head
to insert, create node and then link previous and next nodes 
  need to traverst list to insert also, so O(n) worst-case
access time is not constant like arrays, worst case O(n)
in C++ can be implemented with a struct
Struct Node
{
  int data;
  Node* next;  
}


HEAPS - nearly complete binary tree
from array: just fill in from 1->n then maxheapify()
for (i = floor(length(array)/2); i >= 1; i--) {
  maxheapify(A,i);
}
maxheapify(A,i){}
the last step (when i is at the root) is to simply call Max-Heapify, which fixes the rest of the issues in the Heap. So, to re-cap, first you fill up the heap, top to bottom, left to right (just for visuals - its actually just an array). Next you begin calling Max-Heapify from the bottom (middle of the array) to the top. Max-Heapify will correct any issues within the "sub-tree" that it is working on. As it moves upward, it continually fixes the Heap (all the way to the bottom from where it is currently being called).

binomial heap? In computer science, a binomial heap is a heap similar to a binary heap but also supports quick merging of two heaps. This is achieved by using a special tree structure. It is important as an implementation of the mergeable heap abstract data type (also called meldable heap), which is a priority queue supporting merge operation.
